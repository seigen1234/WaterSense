# WaterSense



## Home Page:
Our homepage contains our logo and gives the users a way to navigate our app.

## Water Conservation Guide:
This feature allow the user to input specific information about their household. Our app will then give the user their estimated water usage, generate fun facts, and ways to inprove their water usage using Open AI’s API. 

## Water Usage Tracker:
Our water usage tracker allows the user to input their meter ID to track their water usage. We integrated UtilityAPI which provides real-time meter data.This feature then gives the user an efficiency score based on the average water usage of a household of similar size. We then used Open AI’s API to generate suggestions for improvement and included an interactive chatbot.

## Weather Data Analysis:
Our last feature used OpenWeather API to read real-time weather data and give the user actions to take based on precipitation levels. During rainfall, WaterSense will suggest ways to collect and store rainwater. When there is no rainfall it advises the user on how to efficiently allocate their available water.
